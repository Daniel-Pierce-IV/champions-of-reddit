# Champions of Reddit

This is a Reddit bot that finds the most upvoted post from the [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) subreddit within a 24 hour time frame, 
and names the author of that post the "Champion of Reddit".

A new champion is named every day in [r/ChampionsOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/), at 11:50PM, UTC-6.

**Features to implement:**
* Temporarily recording potential champions though each 24-hour period
* User messaging API
* "Announcement" of a champion on a post, before the champion makes a comment
